# pdf to Excel

### the idea of this app is to turn floorplans in to excel files with relevant data extracted in the correct form.

- So we upload the floorplans via the browser and give some parameters to the program, note very rudimental atm, ill make the front look nice when I finish this project:

it runs and then spits out the excel file.

- The output looks like this atm:

so obviously some major tuning is needed, but the idea works and we get mostly right data to the right places.
